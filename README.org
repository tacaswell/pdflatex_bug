* description

These are test cases for a very strange interaction I found with
texlive 2012, garphix, pdflatex, a png, and a pdf.  All files needed
to reproduce the bug are included.


If the png jfi_logo is included, and re-sized using
[width=X\linewidth] as an argument of \includegraphics where X < 1 and
the pdf jpd is included after jfi_logo the generated pdf will not open
(error 14) with a range of acrobat readers (version 9 linux, an
(up-to-date?) pro version on mac, and newish version on a mac) if
compiled with texlive 2012 from debian unstable.  If compiled with
texlive 2009, from debian stable, the generated pdf works fine.  In
either case xpdf, okular, and preview will open the generated pdf.

Using different pngs, different pdfs, making jpd go first, or using X>=1, then
both versions of texlive generate a pdf that works with the acrobat 9 (linux).  

* bug
** Action
run pdf latex on *.tex

** Expected 
get pdfs that will open with all pdf readers

** actual 
test_case_fail_1.tex generates a pdf that will not open with acrobat using texlive2012
