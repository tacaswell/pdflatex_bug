These are test cases for a very strange interaction I found with
texlive 2012, garphix, pdflatex, a png, and a pdf.  All files needed
to reproduce the bug are included.


If the png jfi_logo is included, and re-sized using
[width=X\linewidth] as an argument of \includegraphics where X < 1 and
the pdf jpd is included after jfi_logo the generated pdf will not open
(error 14) with a range of acrobat readers (version 9 linux, an
(up-to-date?) pro version on mac, and newish version on a mac) if
compiled with texlive 2012 from debian unstable.  If compiled with
texlive 2009, from debian stable, the generated pdf works fine.

Using different pngs, different pdfs, making jpd go first, or using X>=1, then
both versions of texlive generate a pdf that works with the acrobat 9 (linux).
